# Nikto

Nikto is a free software command-line vulnerability scanner that scans webservers for dangerous files/CGIs, outdated server software and other problems. It performs generic and server type specific checks. It also captures and prints any cookies received.

## Usage

```
# Run using the shebang interpreter
./nikto.pl -h http://www.example.com
# Run using perl (if you forget to chmod)
perl nikto.pl -h http://www.example.com
```

## Examples

### Single Port 

The most basic Nikto scan requires simply a host to target, since port 80 is assumed if none is specified. The host can either be the IP or a hostname of a machine, and is specified using the -h (-host) option. This will scan the IP 192.168.0.1 on TCP port 80:
```
perl nikto.pl -h 192.168.0.1
```
To check on a different port, specify the port number with the -p (-port) option. This will scan the IP 192.168.0.1 on TCP port 443:
```
perl nikto.pl -h 192.168.0.1 -p 443
```
Hosts, ports and protocols may also be specified by using a full URL syntax, and it will be scanned:
```
perl nikto.pl -h https://192.168.0.1:443/
```
There is no need to specify that port 443 is encrypted, as Nikto will first test regular HTTP and if that fails, HTTPS. If you are sure it is an SSL/TLS server, specifying -s (-ssl) very slightly will speed up the test (this is also useful for servers that respond HTTP on port 443 even though content is only served when encryption is used).
```
perl nikto.pl -h 192.168.0.1 -p 443 -ssl
```

### Multiple Ports

Nikto can scan multiple ports in the same scanning session. To test more than one port on the same host, specify the list of ports in the -p (-port) option. Ports can be specified as a range (i.e., 80-90), or as a comma-delimited list, (i.e., 80,88,90). This will scan the host on ports 80, 88 and 443.
```
perl nikto.pl -h 192.168.0.1 -p 80,88,443
```
