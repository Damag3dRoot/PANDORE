## Getting Magento Version 
```
# Magento has 2 mains branches, Magento 1 and Magento 2

# On Magento 2, you can add /magento_version
targetsite.com/magento_version

# On magento 1, you have another login interface at /dowloader
# Versions can be displayed in the footer
https://www.example.com/downloader/
https://www.example.com/magento/downloader/

# You can find the version by comparing hash file signatures 
# between several versions and the running one.
# That's what magescan does.
